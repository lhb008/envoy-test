1.1.0 (November 30, 2016)
=========================

Changes
-------

-   Switch from Jannson to RapidJSON for our JSON library (allowing for
    a configuration schema in 1.2.0).
-   Upgrade
    `recommended version <install_requirements>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} of various other libraries.
-   Configurable DNS refresh rate for DNS service discovery types.
-   Upstream circuit breaker configuration can be
    `overridden via runtime
    <config_cluster_manager_cluster_runtime>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
-   `Zone aware routing support <arch_overview_load_balancing_zone_aware_routing>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
-   Generic header matching routing rule.
-   HTTP/2 graceful connection draining (double GOAWAY).
-   DynamoDB filter
    `per shard statistics <config_http_filters_dynamo>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} (pre-release AWS feature).
-   Initial release of the
    `fault injection HTTP filter <config_http_filters_fault_injection>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
-   HTTP
    `rate limit filter <config_http_filters_rate_limit>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} enhancements (note that the configuration for HTTP rate
    limiting is going to be overhauled in 1.2.0).
-   Added
    `refused-stream retry policy <config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-retry-on>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
-   Multiple
    `priority queues <arch_overview_http_routing_priority>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} for upstream clusters (configurable on a per route
    basis, with separate connection pools, circuit breakers, etc.).

    for setting the logging file flush interval as well as the
    drain/shutdown time during hot restart.
-   A very large number of performance enhancements for core HTTP/TCP
    proxy flows as well as a few new configuration flags to allow
    disabling expensive features if they are not needed (specifically
    request ID generation and dynamic response code stats).
-   Support Mongo 3.2 in the
    `Mongo sniffing filter <config_network_filters_mongo_proxy>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
-   Lots of other small fixes and enhancements not listed.
