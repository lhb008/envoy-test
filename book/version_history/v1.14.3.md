1.14.3 (June 30, 2020)
======================

Changes
-------

-   buffer: fixed CVE-2020-12603 by avoiding fragmentation, and tracking
    of HTTP/2 data and control frames in the output buffer.
-   http: fixed CVE-2020-12604 by changing
    `stream_idle_timeout <envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.stream_idle_timeout>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} to also defend against an HTTP/2 peer that does not open
    stream window once an entire response has been buffered to be sent
    to a downstream client.
-   http: fixed CVE-2020-12605 by including request URL in request
    header size computation, and rejecting partial headers that exceed
    configured limits.
-   listener: fixed CVE-2020-8663 by adding runtime support for
    `per-listener limits <config_listeners_runtime>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} on active/accepted connections.
-   overload management: fixed CVE-2020-8663 by adding runtime support
    for `global limits <config_overload_manager>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} on active/accepted connections.
